Critical gaps (must-have)
NetBox integration
Connect to NetBox API (not just a placeholder)
CRUD operations for NetBox resources (sites, devices, etc.)
Handle NetBox authentication and API responses
Business rules engine
Order validation logic
Transformation rules (order → NetBox resource mapping)
Workflow/state management for orders
Object enrichment
Add computed/derived fields to NetBox objects
Merge data from multiple sources
Add metadata/tags based on business logic
Virtual object mapping
Abstraction layer over NetBox resources
Virtual resources that don't exist in NetBox
Mapping between virtual and physical NetBox objects
Important enhancements (should-have)
Advanced tenant separation
Tenant-specific NetBox filtering
Tenant-scoped resource visibility
Tenant-based access control
Error handling and resilience
Retry logic for NetBox API calls
Circuit breaker pattern
Graceful degradation
Code quality indicators
Clean architecture (separation of concerns)
Dependency injection patterns
Comprehensive error types
Logging and observability
Extensibility
Plugin/strategy pattern for business rules
Configuration-driven mappings
Easy to add new order types
Nice-to-have (differentiators)
Advanced features
Caching layer (Redis/memory)
Async job processing for long operations
Webhook support for NetBox events
Batch operations
Documentation
Architecture diagrams
API documentation completeness
Code comments explaining design decisions
Testing
Integration tests with mock NetBox server
Performance tests
Load testing
Priority order
NetBox integration (real API calls)
Business rules implementation (order → NetBox transformation)
Object enrichment (add computed fields)
Virtual object mapping (abstraction layer)
Advanced tenant separation (NetBox-level filtering)
Error handling and resilience patterns
Focus on demonstrating that you can:
Work with async Rust (tokio) at scale
Design middleware architecture
Implement business logic transformations
Handle real-world API integration challenges
Write maintainable, extensible code
The current MVP shows the foundation; adding these will demonstrate production-ready capabilities.
